# INDE 577 -- Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository for a graduate-level industrial engineering course on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of study that focuses on developing algorithms capable of learning and making predictions or decisions without explicit programming instructions. It has various applications, including simplifying complex problems, adapting to changing environments, and analyzing large datasets.

### Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be applied in diverse areas such as:

- **Personalization**: Enhancing user experiences with tailored recommendations, search results, notifications, and advertisements.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying abnormal patterns in data, such as fraud, spam, hate speech, or medical anomalies like tumors.
- **Interaction**: Enabling natural language processing for chatbots, image recognition, and speech recognition to facilitate interaction with applications.
- **Insights Generation**: Uncovering patterns and trends in data, summarizing documents, and evaluating feature importance.
- **Content Preparation**: Predicting future behavior, optimizing content delivery, and visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Course Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook projects demonstrating machine learning algorithms covered during the Fall 2021 semester at Rice University. The course topics include an introduction to scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow 2, linear and logistic regression, clustering, support vector machines, random forest trees, neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing. Prerequisites include three semesters of calculus and some programming experience.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

The machine learning algorithms discussed in this course fall into three main categories:

### 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled data and are used for tasks such as classification and regression. Examples of supervised learning algorithms covered in this repository include:

- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Perceptron
- Neural Networks
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision/Regression Trees
- Ensemble Learning

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms learn patterns from unlabeled data and are used for tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Examples include:

- K-Means Clustering
- Principle Component Analysis

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves agents learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Algorithms covered in this repository include:

- Q-Learning algorithm
- Graph Theory (a new area of development in reinforcement learning)

## Focus on Human Resources Analytics
