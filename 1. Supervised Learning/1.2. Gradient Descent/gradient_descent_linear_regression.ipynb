    "1. Get a starting point: To begin, we just need a first guess. Ideally this would be \"close\" to the global minimum, but sometimes we have no idea where that might be. Any x where f(x) exists will work. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient: The gradient, or derivative for first order functions, will tell us the direction of the nearest local minimum. If the tangent line at a point has a positive slope, it means the function is increasing, so we'll want to go to the left to get to a \"lower point\". If the tangent line at a point is negative, it means it's decreasing as we move to the right, so we will go to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select a step size / learning rate: This is the distance we want to move (after being multiplied by the gradient) at each iteration. A larger step size will have a more drastic move while smaller ones will take a more precise step towards the local minimum. Different functions will have different \"best\" step sizes, we can make predictions based on the functions, but oftentimes, experimenting with the data will get you to a good result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select a stop condition: Over infinitely many iterations, gradient descent will get you exactly to the local minimum, but as the gradient gets closer and closer to 0, we may want to introduce a stopping condition so our code doesn't run forever. This can look like a number of iterations to do descent or a threshold for the gradient or the change in the cost function at each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat 2-4 taking the initial starting point to now be the previous point - the gradient * step size.\n",
