# Neural Networks:

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, each layer processing information and passing it to the next layer. Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data through a process called training, where they adjust the weights and biases of connections between neurons to minimize a loss function.

## History:

Neural networks have a history dating back to the 1940s. They were initially proposed as a computational model to mimic the behavior of biological neurons. Over the years, advancements in computing power and algorithmic improvements have led to the development of more sophisticated neural network architectures, that are essential for machine learning today. 

## How It Works:

At a high level, a neural network consists of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron takes inputs, applies a mathematical transformation, and produces an output. The connections between neurons, known as weights, are adjusted during a training process to optimize the network's performance.

## Limitations:

While neural networks have shown remarkable performance in many applications, they also have some limitations. These include:

- Need for large amounts of labeled training data
- Computational complexity and resource requirements
- Difficulty in interpreting and explaining the learned representations
